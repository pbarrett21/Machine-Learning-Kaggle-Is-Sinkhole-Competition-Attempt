# Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Is-Sinkhole-Competition-Attempt
Uses various classifiers and methods and the sklearn python library to classify if a given depression is a sinkhole


as per the Kaggle competition description (https://www.kaggle.com/c/UKYCS460g2018sinkhole):

Karst sinkholes are common in the Bluegrass region and can lead to significant, unexpected property damage. Therefore, understanding where they occur is important. Unfortunately, the region is large and it is cost-prohibitive to manually find them all. Therefore, it would be helpful to develop an automated approach.

Each record in this dataset contains features that describe an automatically detected depression in the earth. These were detected using airborne LiDAR imagery but not all of them are sinkholes. All the detected depressions were manually classified as being either sinkhole or not. Your challenge is to use these manually labeled depressions to train a fully automatic method. 


Methods/classifiers I use:

* Shallow Decision Tree
* Deep Decision Tree
* Random Forest


with grid search to find best parameters and hyperparameters, and cross validation
